 # Reference Catalog of Data Quality Requirement Patterns
The Reference catalog of Data Quality Requirement (DQR) Patterns is designed to support Data Space Governance Authorities in defining and managing data quality throughout the governance and operational processes underpinning their data spaces. It enables authorities to elicit DQRs by selecting and instantiating relevant patterns, thereby constructing a data space specific DQR catalog tailored to their governance and operational needs. 

These patterns capture common and recurring DQRs encountered in data space data sharing and governance scenarios. For each pattern in the catalog, the associated data quality dimension, a textual description of the requirement, its general specification, and the elements to be instantiated by stakeholders are explicitly defined.


| Quality Dimension | DQR Description | General Specification | Information to Pattern Instantiation |
| ----------------- | --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Timeless | A specific data age is required for the data in an attribute of an entity | x | y |
